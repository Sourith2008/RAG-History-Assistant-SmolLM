    Class IX History RAG Assistant is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built around the NCERT Class IX History textbook, India and the Contemporary World-I.

The system first converts the user's question into an embedding and retrieves relevant textbook passages using FAISS. A CrossEncoder reranker then ranks the retrieved passages by relevance. The selected context is passed to Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, which generates the final answer.

Pipeline:
Question → Embedding → FAISS Retrieval → CrossEncoder Reranking → Qwen2.5 → Answer

The project is designed to demonstrate how retrieval, reranking, and instruction-following generation can be combined to build a lightweight, domain-specific AI assistant.

Note: The underlying language model is a compact 0.5B-parameter model, so occasional factual or contextual errors may occur. Answers should be verified against the textbook when accuracy is critical.

Tip: Ask clear questions for precise answers. The assistant is designed for concise, exam-friendly responses rather than long essays.
